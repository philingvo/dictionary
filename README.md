This is the **Dictionary server** for the **Philingvo** project.

This is a real website based on the Django framework. So user performs main activities on web pages of the site.
User manually creates sets of words or expressions that are used for activity with the LED ticker.
Pronunciations can be generated automatically using the Google text to speech library or can be uploaded by user.
The Dictionary Server can import sets from Quizlet. Also there is a special file format for importing and exporting sets so people can share their sets between each other.

All project's software parts:
1. [LED Server](https://github.com/philingvo/led_server)
2. [Graphic Interface Application](https://github.com/philingvo/remote_unit_interface)
3. [Dictionary](https://github.com/philingvo/dictionary)
